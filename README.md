# Four Squares

A mental maths game where you need to find four squares that add up to the displayed number

Example: If the problem is 6281, you can write that as the sum of four squares as follows:
$$6281 = 60^2 + 50^2 + 10^2 + 9^2$$
So to enter this solution, simply concatenate all the digits of the solution together:
```
6050109
```
Note: concatenating less than four numbers and/or prepending garbage to a solution are also considered valid answers.

The skip button will reset the game, so you have to solve the problem given or start over.

For the TIME TRIAL mode, try to solve as many problems as you can in 5 minutes.

For the CLEAR 30 mode, try to solve 30 problems as fast as you can.
